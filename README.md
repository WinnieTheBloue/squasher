# Squasher

Squasher is an application designed to facilitate the tracking and refereeing of squash matches. Developed as part of a personal rush, this application focuses on functionality and speed, avoiding the use of external components.

## Key Features

- **Player Registration:** Allows recording of two players participating in the match, assigning each a distinct color for easy identification.
- **Service Management:** At the beginning of the match, the application asks which player is serving. This feature is essential for correctly following the progress of the match.
- **Tracking Server Change:** With each change of server, the application requests from which side the player starts serving. This helps maintain accurate tracking in accordance with squash rules.
- **Match Refereeing:** The application is designed to be a useful tool in refereeing squash matches, providing a clear and easy-to-use interface for tracking the progress of the game.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3 and Vite:** Use of Vue 3 for a reactive user interface and Vite for rapid and efficient development.
